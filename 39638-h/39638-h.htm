<p><span class="smcap">Praise</span>&mdash;when it is fairly
earned and justly due, is that meed which virtue delights to
bestow upon merit; and, as it is highly gratifying to every
worthy mind to receive, so next to those who merit it, it is to
none more delightful than to those who are allied to, and love
and regard the object of the Eulogy.&nbsp; Most grateful then
must it be to the feelings of a beloved wife, to hear and even
read of the honorable and praise-worthy actions of a kind and
tender husband.&nbsp; It is indeed like the <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>oil of
gladness to the heart, which, while it softens and lubricates,
rejoices and refines: while it is read it delights&mdash;inspires
a desire to imitate&mdash;infuses a portion of the spirit it
celebrates into the bosom of rectitude&mdash;and cherishes the
noble incentive to &ldquo;go and do likewise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under
this impression it is, that the Author has presumed to dedicate
to your Ladyship, this humble tribute of his respect and
esteem.&nbsp; If he must not be allowed to rank it with the
brighter effusions of imagination; yet, being founded in truth,
it is intrinsically superior to the flights of fancy, and he
trusts when you consider the justness of the panegyric, and the
sincerity which inspires it; you will look over the imperfection
of the Performance, in regard to the goodness of the intention;
and readily pardon the writers defects of genius in justice to
the warmth of his feelings.</p>

<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>TO
THE READER.</h2>
<p>The principal part of the following little Poem (if it
deserves so high a character) was composed ten or a dozen years
ago, and is extracted from a much longer Eulogy upon our Great
Patriot, his Holkham, and his Agriculture; but which, for reasons
not necessary to mention here, has never met the public eye; nor
would what is here published, have done so now, had the Author
been aware of any Competitor in the same field, who had attempted
to do justice to the great and good man whose fame he aspires to
sing.&nbsp; But now the Guardian of our County&rsquo;s rights,
her liberties and laws, has resigned his seat in Parliament, and
after seeing the great measures for which he so long contended in
the House of Commons (namely, a Reform in the
Representation&mdash;a repeal of <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>the Corporation and Test
Acts&mdash;and the destruction of the rotten Boroughs;) granted
to the energetic exertions of a great People, aided by the
support of a Patriotic Monarch, and a wise Ministry; has retired
to the Sylvan shades of his wide domain, to enjoy the well earned
meed of public virtue and private spirit; the Author could no
longer delay presenting this humble tribute to his fame, and he
trusts it will now be deemed neither misplaced nor ill timed, and
although its pretensions are so humble, yet as they are ardent
and sincere, he hopes it will be received with the candour and
indulgence such trifles (while they survive) are usually
received, when the praise is so justly due&mdash;so dearly
earned&mdash;and so seldom deserved; in which case he will be
highly gratified and his labour amply rewarded.</p>

TRIBUTE.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Yes</span>&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Britons boast</span>! in these dark times to
know<br />
A man whose Virtue gilds the world below;<br />
And, like the glory of the Northern star,<br />
Is known, admired and gazed at from afar;<br />
Who though he shines so high above his kind,<br />
Is Polar light to Peasantry and Hind;<br />
And yet his county, to her lasting shame,<br />
No Bard has roused to eulogize his name;<br />
To paint the Virtues in a mortal shrine,<br />
And point the gem by its refulgent shine.<br />
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>So be it
mine to touch the sounding string,<br />
The <span class="smcap">Friend</span>; the <span
class="smcap">Patriot</span>; and the <span
class="smcap">Man</span> to sing.<br />
O could I reach the famed Apollo&rsquo;s lyre;<br />
I&rsquo;d chaunt his praises with a Poets fire;<br />
But if unequal to such lofty flights,<br />
My subject warms me, and my task delights;<br />
And though unused to raise the tuneful song,<br />
The <span class="smcap">mighty theme</span> shall make my numbers
strong;<br />
Bright <span class="smcap">truth</span> shall guide me, like the
solar rays,<br />
Illume my darkness and direct my praise!<br />
Inspire each thought, and breathe in ev&rsquo;ry line,<br />
And grace my Eulogy with rays divine;<br />
And, while I paint the scene, the fact recite,<br />
Still burst upon me in a blaze of light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Wake then my <span class="smcap">Muse</span>
the gen&rsquo;rous trump of fame,<br />
And let her clarion laud the Patriot&rsquo;s name;<br />
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Whose
glorious actions well deserve the lay,<br />
In deathless strains his merits to pourtray;<br />
Who, while he makes his much loved <span
class="smcap">Holkham</span> smile,<br />
Exalts the glory of our Sea girt Isle.<br />
What though short lived, my tribute I will bring,<br />
And add my feather to the Eagle&rsquo;s wing;<br />
Upon his pinions striving, thus to climb,<br />
Upborne awhile along the stream of time,<br />
And tho&rsquo; my garland may fall off, his plumes<br />
A grateful Muse her transient song presumes.</p>
<p class="poetry">See the great <span class="smcap">Farmer</span>
at his rural seat,<br />
When cares of state admit of his retreat;<br />
Within his noble hospitable dome,<br />
The Prince as well as Peasant finds a home;<br />
Born for the <i>world</i> and for his race designed,<br />
His Godlike bounty flows for all mankind;<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Receives the
Stranger, as a welcome guest,<br />
Who while he tarries, feels no wish unbless&rsquo;d;<br />
The Patriot there with gay and cheerful heart,<br />
Mid&rsquo; all his greatness has the happy art,<br />
To set each timid visitor at ease,<br />
By courteous manners ever apt to please;<br />
Where, open as his hand, th&rsquo;expanding door, <br />
Receives the wealthy where he feeds the poor;<br />
Where none are seen to sorrow or complain;<br />
Within the circle of his wide domain,<br />
Abundance reigns; and comfort sweetly flows;<br />
And, like the shadow, follows where he goes:<br />
No discontent is felt when he is nigh,<br />
And anxious cares before his presence fly;<br />
The faithful hind rejoicing in his smile,<br />
With cheerful industry pursues his toil;<br />
The gen&rsquo;rous rustic glories in his sight,<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Who makes
his heavy burden weigh more light;<br />
And feels exalted and rejoiced to find;<br />
The best of masters of the human kind;<br />
Proud of his kindred, then he seems to scan,<br />
His inbred worth, and deems himself a man.</p>
<p class="poetry">O if the man who makes a single blade,<br />
Lift its green head above the parched glade;<br />
Where never verdure did before appear,<br />
Deserves the plaudits of the world to hear;<br />
What shall we say of him whose arts contrive,<br />
To make whole fields of smiling herbage thrive;<br />
Who turns the moor, into a fertile vale,<br />
Where flocks and herds inhale the vernal gale;<br />
Congeals the sand upon the northern breeze<br />
And decorates the waste with shrubs and trees:<br />
Such worth as this should like the sunbeams blaze,<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>And
sculptur&rsquo;d marbles speak to sing his praise;<br />
Fame raise him pillars in each land and clime,<br />
And Poets praise him in the song sublime;<br />
The deathless laurel round his temples twine,<br />
And his immortal wreath untarnish&rsquo;d shine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry">On lib&rsquo;ral terms his Tenants are
posses&rsquo;d;<br />
Their contracts made, they feel themselves at rest;<br />
Their tenures permanent, at easy rents,<br />
None make a bargain which he e&rsquo;er repents;<br />
But once engaged, he finds his contract please;<br />
Assured of independence, peace and ease.<br />
The honor&rsquo;d Landlord thus his rights maintains,<br />
And like a Father o&rsquo;er his Children reigns;<br />
His reign is arbitrary &rsquo;tis confess&rsquo;d,<br />
Because he gains possession of the breast;<br />
And wins the affections, of the gen&rsquo;rous hind,<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>By noble
dealings and by actions kind;<br />
Who tho&rsquo; he spurns the mean desire of pelf,<br />
Enriching others meets reward himself.<br />
Of him ye Landlords learn the only way,<br />
To make your Acres your high hopes repay;<br />
And know that only by a lasting lease,<br />
Your lands ye can improve, your wealth increase;<br />
See this plain truth, clear as the solar ray,<br />
In COKE&rsquo;S large rental, swelling ev&rsquo;ry day;<br />
Turn but your eyes to <span class="smcap">Holkham&rsquo;s</span>
fertile plain,<br />
And see it proved in ev&rsquo;ry joyous swain;<br />
Behold how riches, in a Patriot&rsquo;s hand,<br />
Diffuse abundance thro&rsquo; a steril land;<br />
And view how wealth, when properly applied,<br />
Scatters her golden lustre far and wide.<br />
Within the narrow space of fifty years;<br />
How Nature&rsquo;s rugged face improv&rsquo;d appears;<br />
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Where scarce
a sheep cot rais&rsquo;d its shelt&rsquo;ring head,<br />
To screen the Shepherd as his flocks he fed;<br />
Now graceful mansions glad the Traveller&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
And socialize the hills on which they rise;<br />
Where here and there a dome of antique taste,<br />
Made solitude appear amid the waste;<br />
Now ornamental buildings grace the spot,<br />
And population cheers the humble cot:<br />
Where not a briar would rise to deck the heath,<br />
Nor wild <i>flower</i> bloom to paint a May day wreath;<br />
Now cooling groves and flowery sweets are seen,<br />
To form a landscape mid&rsquo; the varied scene;<br />
Within whose sylvan shades we see reside,<br />
In ease, content, and independent pride;<br />
The <span class="smcap">Norfolk Yeomen</span> rearing Heroes
brave,<br />
To guard <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> while she rules the
wave;<br />
Just such a <i>Peasantry</i> in heart and nerve,<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>As
<i>England&rsquo;s Genius</i> glories to preserve.</p>
<p class="poetry">Amid the fruitful hills and smiling vales,<br
/>
Each grateful Tenant, his loved Landlord hails;<br />
Whose spacious mansion tow&rsquo;ring to the skies,<br />
Central we see majestically rise;<br />
Around whose bright demesnes, a happy race<br />
Of wealthy Farmers share the fertile space;<br />
And while they feel his favours grateful glow,<br />
Though from his streams their smaller streamlets flow;<br />
In chrystal currents, gliding pure and clear,<br />
Through all the country round the swains to cheer.<br />
Though his bright beams, just like the orb of day,<br />
The lesser stars eclipses with his ray;<br />
It warms, illumes, and gladdens as it shines,<br />
Each minor Planet which around him twines<br />
While as they circle near their central sun,<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Illumin&rsquo;d by his light their course they run;<br
/>
Fed from his flame they own his golden rays,<br />
And glisten round him in a silver blaze.</p>
<p class="poetry">When Heavens indulgence joineth earth to
skies,<br />
In nice gradations does the chain arise;<br />
From beast to man, from man the links extend,<br />
Angels to Seraphs rise, and these ascend,<br />
In shining orders, unto us unknown,<br />
All stretching forward to the Empyrean throne;<br />
Yet never destined, in their loftiest flight,<br />
To reach the glorious source of life and light.<br />
Thus if mens acts with Heavens we may compare,<br />
<span class="smcap">Norfolk&rsquo;s great Commoner</span> his
fame would rear;<br />
Lifting the poor Plebeian from the dust,<br />
The chain extending to a place of trust;<br />
The trusty Servant to a Bailiff springs;<br />
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>The
Bailiff sinks, a cheerful Farmer sings;<br />
The Farmer grows in wealth, wealth has no worth,<br />
Until dispers&rsquo;d among the sons of earth;<br />
His Children rise with wealth, they learning gain,<br />
And knowledge still extends the golden chain;<br />
Wisdom in Virtue ends, and thus he tries<br />
To raise a lowly Peasant to the skies;<br />
Thus imitating Heaven while here below,<br />
Endeavouring so his image fair to show,<br />
In pristine beauty, bursting from the clay,<br />
As from his makers hand, he sprung to day.</p>

<p class="poetry">Could such a man then in the <i>shades</i>
remain,<br />
To cheer the heart and bless the labouring swain?<br />
No, worth like his, which Greece or Rome might praise!<br />
Wisdom denied this solace of his days;<br />
And call&rsquo;d him forth, to glad the noble band,<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Of

To <span class="smcap">Britains Senate</span> <i>Virtue</i>

own.<br />
Just at the crisis of that wasteful war,<br />
Which misled Albion proclaim&rsquo;d afar,<br />
Across the Atlantic wave, where Slaughter stood,<br />
And dyed the British hand with British blood;<br />
Then as the County&rsquo;s Genius look&rsquo;d around,<br />
To where her worthiest offspring might be found;<br />
Soon <span class="smcap">Holkham&rsquo;s</span> glitt&rsquo;ring
turrets she discerned,<br />
Where in her <span class="smcap">Coke</span> the heart of <span
class="smcap">Cato</span> burned;<br />
There like the good <i>Cincennatus</i> at plough,<br />
In olden times, she &rsquo;spied her Patriot now;<br />
And call&rsquo;d him thence, to help the ship of state,<br />
Where frightful rocks, were frowning big with fate;<br />
To guide her safely o&rsquo;er the threat&rsquo;ning shoal,<br />
And keep her freightage safe, her timbers whole.<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Then love

Still faithful found among a faithless crew;<br />

Their numbers few in intellect were strong,<br />
For <span class="smcap">Pitt</span> and <span

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
